## faas-cli

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexellis/faas-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexellis/faas-cli)

This experimental CLI can be used to and deploy functions to FaaS or to build Node.js or Python functions from a templates meaning you just write a handler file (handler.py/handler.js). Read on for examples and usage.

> Functions as a Service is a serverless framework for Docker: [Read more on docs.get-faas.com](http://docs.get-faas.com/)

### Running the tool

The tool can be used to create a Docker image to be deployed on FaaS through a template meaning you only have to write a single handler file. The templates currently supported are: node and python, however you can create a FaaS function out of any process.

#### YAML files for easy of use

You can define individual functions or a set of of them within a YAML file. This makes the CLI easier to use and means you can use this file to deploy to your FaaS instance.

Here is an example file using the `samples.yml` file included in the repository.

```
provider:
  name: faas
  gateway: http://localhost:8080

functions:
  url_ping:
    lang: python
    handler: ./sample/url_ping
    image: alexellis2/faas-urlping
```

This url_ping function is defined in the samples/url__ping folder makes use of Python. All we had to do was to write a `handler.py` file and then to list off any Python modules in `requirements.txt`.

* Build the files in the .yml file:

```
$ ./faas-cli -action build -yaml ./samples.py
```

Docker along with a Python template will be used to build an image named alexellis2/faas-urlping.

* Deploy your function

Now you can use the following command to deploy your function(s):

```
$ ./faas-cli -action deploy -yaml ./samples.py
```

* Possible entries for functions are documented below:

```
functions:
  deployed_function_name:
    lang: node or python (optional)
    handler: ./path/to/handler (optional)
    image: docker-image-name
    environment:
      env1: value1
      env2: "value2"
```

Use environmental variables for setting tokens and configuration.

*Read on for manual CLI instructions.*

### Installation / pre-requirements

* Docker

Install Docker because it is used to build Docker images if you create new functions.

* FaaS - deployed and live

This CLI can build and deploy templated functions, so it's best if you have FaaS started up on your laptop. Head over to http://docs.get-faas.com/ and get up and running with a sample stack in 60 seconds.

* Golang

> Here's how to install Go in 60 seconds.

* Grab Go 1.7.x from https://golang.org/dl/

Then after installing run this command or place it in your `$HOME/.bash_profile`

```
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
```

* Now clone / build `faas-cli`:

```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/alexellis/
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/alexellis/
$ git clone https://github.com/alexellis/faas-cli
$ cd faas-cli
$ go get -d -v
$ go build
```

### Manual CLI options

*Update: read-on for YAML support.*

#### Worked example with Node.js

So if you want to write in another language, just prepare a Dockerfile and build an image manually, like in the [FaaS samples](https://github.com/alexellis/faas/tree/master/sample-functions).

**Build a FaaS function in NodeJS from a template:**

This will generate a Docker image for a Node.js function using the code in `/samples/info`.

* The `faas-cli` can accept a `-lang` option of `python` or `node` and is `node` by default.

```
   $ ./faas-cli -action=build \
      -image=alexellis2/node_info \
      -name=node_info \
      -handler=./sample/node_info

Building: alexellis2/node_info with Docker. Please wait..
...
Image: alexellis2/node_info built.
```

You can customise the code by editing the handler.js file and changing the `-handler` parameter. You can also edit the packages.json file, which will be used during the build to make sure all your dependencies are available at runtime.

For example:

```
"use strict"

module.exports = (context, callback) => {
    console.log("echo - " + context);
    
    callback(undefined, {status: "done"});
}
```

The CLI will then build a Docker image containing the FaaS watchdog and a bootstrap file to invoke your NodeJS function.

**Deploy the Docker image as a FaaS function:**

Now we can deploy the image as a named function called `node_info`.

```
$ ./faas-cli -action=deploy \
   -image=alexellis2/node_info \
   -name=node_info

200 OK

URL: http://localhost:8080/function/node_info
```

> This tool can be used to deploy any Docker image as a FaaS function, as long as it includes the watchdog binary as the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` of the image.

*Deploy remotely*

You can deploy to a remote FaaS instance as along as you push the image to the Docker Hub, or another accessible Docker registry. Specify your remote gateway with the following flag: `-gateway=http://remote-site.com:8080`

**Making use of YAML**

You can also make use of YAML to manage one or more functions in the same file, and reduce the amount of typing required.

Here's an example yaml file for the samples:

```
provider:
  name: faas
  gateway: http://localhost:8080

functions:
  captainsList:
    lang: node
    handler: ./sample/getCaptains
    image: alexellis2/faas-getcaptains

  urlPing:
    lang: python
    handler: ./sample/py
    image: alexellis2/faas-urlping
```

You can run `./faas-cli -action build -yaml ./test.yml` followed by `./faas-cli -action build -yaml ./test.yml`

Possible entries for functions are:

```
functions:
  deployed_function_name:
    lang: node or python (optional)
    handler: ./path/to/handler (optional)
    image: docker-image-name
    environment:
      env1: value1
      env2: "value2"
```

**Accessing the function with `curl`**

You can initiate a HTTP POST via `curl`:

* with the `-d` flag i.e. `-d "my data here"` 
* or with `--data-binary @filename.txt` to send a whole file including newlines
* if you want to pass input from STDIN then use `--data-binary @-`

```
$ curl -d '{"hello": "world"}' http://localhost:8080/function/node_info
{ nodeVersion: 'v6.9.1', input: '{"hello": "world"}' }

$ curl --data-binary @README.md http://localhost:8080/function/node_info

$ uname -a | curl http://localhost:8080/function/node_info --data-binary @-
```
